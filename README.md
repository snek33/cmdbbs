Hello. This is the batch program I made back in 2019, to demonstrate that this kind of thing was possible to a friend.

It's a pretty basic reddit-like bbs, and it's probably useless unless the r and users file are in a network
directory and every single directory in the program is changed accordingly, manually. Everything else is pretty straight forward.

Unfortunately there is no way to create users besides copying one of the USR files in the "users" directory and changing
it's name and password. There is one example user for you to start with.

I don't really plan on maintaining this program anymore so, expect something more like a pain in the ass to use demo.
